                        Season 6, also known as Season VI, was the sixth season of Hermitcraft. It is the longest
                        season
                        of Hermitcraft so far, standing at 19 months and 2 days. The Season 6 world was created on
                        the
                        1.13 version of Minecraft, and it was gradually updated until settling on version 1.14.4,
                        never
                        updating to 1.15. Throughout the season, many rival shopping corporations formed, including
                        ConCorp, Sahara, and Idea. Also it introduced the game Demise.
                        <br><br>
                        The season ending was announced on February 21, 2020.

                        This season's world was based on a large island where most of the Hermits established their
                        bases with a lake referred to as Aqua Town in the center. The island was divided into seven
                        districts based on different building themes.

                    <p>
                        Demise was an event started by Grian. It costs 50 diamonds to sign up. The Hermits couldn't
                        use
                        diamond armour, but they could enchant lesser armour however they want to. The Hermits
                        competed
                        to be the last one alive without PvP while doing business as usual. The last one alive would
                        win
                        all the signup diamonds. The total amount of diamonds added to 900 or 14 stacks and 4. When
                        a
                        Hermit died, they would change their skin to a grey/silver, monochrome version of their skin
                        and
                        help eliminate the other Hermits with pranks.<br>
                        The event was supposted to be a litle game for halloween, however the Hermits enjoyed the
                        game
                        so much they decided to continue playing. <br><br>
                        The event began on October 15, 2019, and ended on December 24, 2019 when Docm77 met his
                        demise,
                        leaving Iskall85 as the winner of the competition.

    <h2>This is fy first blog post</h2>
    <p>
      This is a very <strong>strong</strong> text, because it is <strong>bold</strong>.
      <br>
      I would like to <em>emphasize</em> how important it is to follow this course until the end!
      <br>
      This is some <u>underlined</u> text.

      Sam and Dean are sitting in the bunker's library with some spare time now that they defeated Chuck. Sam is reading a book from the men of letters about angels. They used a spell from that book to get Cas back from the empty. Cas and Jack are visiting Jody and the girls to tell them how they defeated Chuck.
      <br>

      "So get this," Sam said, "there appears to be a ritual for angels to get bonded. It says that the bonding is something that we would call marriage." "Serious Sam. Why are you even reading this stuff in your free time?" "Well, it's interesting." "Nerd." "Jerk." "Bitch." Sam lays down the book to get a beer from the fridge. In the meantime, Dean hurries to get the book Sam was reading and makes some pictures of the bonding ritual to read it later. When Sam walks back in with two beers, one for him and one for Dean, everything looks back normal.

    <h2>HTML is amazing</h2>
    <p>That same evening Cas and Jack come back from Jody's place. As soon as they walk into the library Sam says, "Hey Cas, look at this! Is it true what they say here about angel marriages?" Cas looks a bit confused. "Eh yes, this information appears to be correct." "Does the bonding also work this way with a human and an angel?" Sam asked. "As far as I know, a bonding between an angel and a human will work the same way as between two angels. Although, I don't know what effect the bonding   will have, physically, on a human." They let the subject rest for the rest of the evening and they chose to listen to Jack and Cas talk about Claire and Kaia who appear to be together.
